# Maps as Data

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for [MapReader](https://github.com/maps-as-data/MapReader) and related packages! Our mission is to develop and maintain powerful, user-friendly tools that leverage computer vision for exploring, analyzing, and understanding large collections of images, with a particular focus on historical maps.

Originally developed as part of the Living with Machines project, [MapReader](https://github.com/maps-as-data/MapReader) was designed to address complex geospatial and historical research questions. It has since evolved into a versatile, general-purpose computer vision pipeline, capable of handling a wide range of image analysis tasks across various domains.

Within this organization, you'll find repositories that [house the core MapReader package](https://github.com/maps-as-data/MapReader) as well as complementary tools, documentation, tutorials, and example workflows. Whether you're a historian, data scientist, geospatial analyst, or a researcher from another field, our tools are designed to help you unlock the full potential of your image datasets.
